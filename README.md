Plot 1 is about describing all the movies in one word and put it to the plot. We have 14 categories total and most popular are lost nand doomed, very popular, almost 70 movies total for each of that 2 categories. Some of the other caterogies that have the least number of movies are successful, flipped, pg, incomplete, true, epic, timeless, getting less popular and not a lot of people want to watch these categories in 2010 time period.

Plot 2 is about asking how good all the movies are and rank them. We have 14 levels total, and surprise, we have a lot of movies (more than 100) that are excellent, highest compared other levels. Few movies are ranked as epic, different, rated, and incompleted. Thats showing that we have numerous of good movies, very few that are incomplete overall in 2010
